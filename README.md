# Smart-Weather-Station

In this project, we will develop a weather station with ML for remote regions without internet access
The microcontroller will use the temperature and humidity sensors to predict snowfall based on the data from the last three hours
TensorFlow Lite is used as a framework for model development
The project is based on Arduino Nano 33 Sense board with built-in temperature and humidity sensor
